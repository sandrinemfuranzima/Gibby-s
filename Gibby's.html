            <h4>Why learning Programming!</h4>
            <p>Weâ€™re living in the era of technology, and technological growth is nowhere near stopping. As the use of technological devices is growing every year, there will always be a high demand for programmers. The Bureau of Labor Statistics stated
                that within this decade, computer programming jobs would mostly be available to those outside the United States. This due to the fact that companies are considering employing people all around the world since they would pay them lower
                wages.
            </p>

            <p>However, jobs such as software developing, web developing, computer system analysts, and others show a good career outlook for the next 10 years. Their estimated growth is from 9% and up to 21% for <span><strong>software development jobs</strong></span>.</p>
